#  Kunal Ranjan - Cybersecurity Professional

##  **About Me**

**`Cybersecurity Analyst & AI Enthusiast | Digital Defender | Code Cracker & Network Fortifier`**

Hello there! I'm Kunal (pronounced "Koo-nal" - yes, like "cool" but with a twist). I'm a cybersecurity professional who believes that the best defense is a good offense, and the best offense is understanding your enemy better than they understand themselves.

###  **What I Do**
I specialize in protecting digital assets from the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. Think of me as a digital security guard, but instead of a flashlight, I use advanced threat intelligence and AI-powered tools. (And yes, I do occasionally talk to my computer - it's called debugging, not insanity!)

###  **Current Mission**
Developing a Cybersecurity CLI tool that streamlines vulnerability assessments and incident responses. Because let's face it, in cybersecurity, time is money, and every second counts when you're racing against a potential breach.
